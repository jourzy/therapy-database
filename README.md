MYSQL database for a therapist

## Project description

I created a MYSQL database for a therapist.
He needs to store client details including session notes securely.
He needs to keep records of income and expenses for tax purposes.
He needs to be able to manage his booking in his diary.

He currently stores all this data on a number of different word processing and spreadsheet files.
This database will enable the user to store all data in one place securely.
All data in this project is made up.

I would like to develop this project so that the database is accessible through a web app or mobile app.
I would like to develop this database to ensure that it meets the GDPR standards for data security.

Due to time restraints I was not able to develop the database fully but I aim to continue to improve it over time.
